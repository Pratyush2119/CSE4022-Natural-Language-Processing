Hello everyone. My name is Pratyush Panda. I belong to a family of 4 members and I am the youngest child. I live in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. I secured CGPA 10 in class X and 89.4% in Class XII under the CBSE board. Currently, I am a final year student at the Vellore Institute of Technology, Chennai. I am pursuing my B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I have always been very fascinated in computers and the technology used. My main area of interest is Web Development. I find it very interesting to know how each and every functionality on a web site works, how those functionalities are designed in creative ways to give a better user experience. To know more about it I had enrolled in different online courses. Currently, I am interning as a PHP Web Developer at a Start-up company. I am also an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner. My hobbies are – singing and listening to music, reading adventure and mystery stories and comics, binging web series and movies and cycling. I like calm and quiet environment. I like my things and room to be organized. I am very much eager to learn new concepts and courses, but I can’t do it in a rushed and pressurized manner. I need my time and a peace environment to learn the concepts. I believe that studying can never be done in a hurried manner.
